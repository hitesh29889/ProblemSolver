        <p>
            Current boilerplate template I have downloaded from this link <a rel="stylesheet" href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Templates"> boilerplate </a>
            is with .Net as backend and ReactJS as front-end technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            This boilerplate code ReactJS project comes with Ant design. <a rel="stylesheet" href="https://ant.design/">Ant Design </a>
            It uses AntDesign UI component for menu, layout, forms all the things we seen in demo.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I have integrated syncfusion controls into this project, its works fine, I have forcefully installed the required packages and now grid,forms and other components
            works fine in this demo.
            But problem is the design.
            See below screenshots
        </p>
        <img src="./img/img1.PNG" height="500px" width="800px" />
        <img src="./img/img2.PNG" height="500px" width="800px" />
        <img src="./img/img3.PNG" height="500px" width="800px" />

        <p>
            So my question is, do I have to rewrite everything given by boilerplate front-end project to use syncfusion theme/layout/menu etc.
            Or I can integrate both (ant design and syncfusion controls) without affecting eachother.
            Current layout/menu/theme is from ant design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Syncfusion provide lot of customization to use theme/structure of bootstrap4/bootstrap5/material design etc. But not in ant design structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ant design also have all the component we required. forms/tabs/buttons etc which is also customizable.
        </p>
